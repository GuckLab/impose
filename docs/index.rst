With impose, you can superimpose different imaging modalities
(e.g. fluorescence imaging and Brillouin microscopy) and use the
structural information from one modality to extract quantitative
information from the other modality. This is particularly useful
if you have no other means of mapping one imaging modality to
the other (different stage or microscope).
